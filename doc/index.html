    <h1>An AJAX Erlang Jukebox</h1>

    <h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>

    <p>
      Very briefly,
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Install <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>.</li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Make sure your copy of <a
	  href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> works
	  properly.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If you want support for a volume control, ensure amixer is present and 
      works properly.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Download and install the Erlang RFC4627/JSON/JSON-RPC module
	  by <code>git clone <a
	  href="http://tonyg.github.com/erlang-rfc4627/">git://github.com/tonyg/erlang-rfc4627</a></code>,
	  compiling it, and making sure it's available on your Erlang
	  path (e.g. by symlinking it into your
	  <code>/usr/lib/erlang/lib</code> directory, or by copying
	  the <code>*.beam</code> files into the Erlang Jukebox's
	  <code>ebin</code> directory).
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
		Copy src/settings.hrl.example to src/settings.hrl and edit
		as appropriate for your local system.
	</p>
	</li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Type <code>make</code>. If all goes well, try <code>make
	  run</code>, which will start the application in an
	  interactive Erlang shell. Running <code>make daemon</code>
	  will start the application running in the
	  background. Running <code>make stop</code> will shut down a
	  running jukebox.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The application is usually accessible on port 8888 (see <a
      href="../priv/server_root/conf/httpd.conf">httpd.conf</a> if you
      want to change this), so once it's running, you should see the
      main user interface at
    </p>

    <p align="center">
      <code><a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a></code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing you'll need to do is add a root URL for the
      application to spider. Visit the configuration interface at
    </p>

    <p align="center">
      <code><a
      href="http://localhost:8888/config.html">http://localhost:8888/config.html</a></code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Enter a URL
      (e.g. <code>http://mymachine/path/to/my/iTunes%20Folder/</code>)
      in the field next to the "Add root" button, and click on the
      button. The system will start scanning the directory hierarchy
      beneath the URL you entered.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it's done, the URL will appear in the "All roots" section
      of the display.
    </p>

    <h2>Code Overview</h2>

    <h3>The Music Server and Track Database</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>jukebox.erl, jukebox_supervisor.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	This is the entry point for the whole server-side program. It
	starts the HTTP daemon, spider service, the track database,
	the player service, the volume control service, and the main
	history/chat recorder.
      </dd>

      <dt>execdaemon.c, execdaemon.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	These programs fill a gap in Erlang's support for POSIX
	process control and signalling. After having a good go at
	using its built-in mechanisms for spawning other Unix
	processes, I decided I wasn't getting the control I needed, so
	hacked together this external controller program to act as a
	buffer between Erlang and the Unix world. The execdaemon.c
	program speaks a simple command language over stdin/stdout,
	discards the output of its child processes, and provides an
	interface to two functions: <code>execv(3)</code> and
	<code>kill(2)</code>. The execdaemon.erl module provides an
	Erlang wrapper around execdaemon.c's functionality.
      </dd>

      <dt>history.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	This module &mdash; all 41 lines of it! &mdash; implements a
	simple logging or chat service. It's used in the jukebox as a
	simple IRC-like AJAX chat panel, allowing Jukebox users to
	talk to each other via the Jukebox UI.
      </dd>

      <dt>player.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	This module maps filename extensions to player commands (such
	as mpg123, ogg123, etc.), and uses execdaemon.erl to manage an
	external player process. It also manages the main queue of
	tracks to play, supporting operations such as enqueueing a
	track or a <code>.m3u</code> playlist, moving a track around
	in the queue, removing a track from the queue, skipping the
	remainder of the currently-playing track, and pausing and
	unpausing the current player process.
      </dd>

      <dt>spider.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	This module recursively explores directory hierarchies exposed
	as HTML. A regular expression matching 'href="..."' extracts
	sub-URLs from each retrieved page. Leaf URLs are accumulated
	and returned to the caller, and Non-leaf (subdirectory) URLs
	are retrieved and processed in turn.
      </dd>

      <dt>tqueue.erl, tqueue.hrl</dt>
      <dd>
	This module implements a "track queue" data structure, built
	upon Erlang's library <code>queue</code> module. Each entry in
	a track queue consists of an ID, a track URL, and optionally a
	username associated with the entry. The track queue structure,
	and its contained track structures, are the core structures
	used in communication between the user interface and the
	server side of the application.
      </dd>

      <dt>trackdb.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	This module manages the database of all discovered tracks,
	using spider.erl to scan the root URLs. It provides procedures
	for listing, adding, removing and rescanning roots, as well as
	for searching the database.
      </dd>

      <dt>volume.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	This module uses the external program <code>hmix</code> to
	query and adjust mixer settings.
	</dd>

	<dt>lastfm.erl, md5.erl</dt>
	<dd>
		A last.fm interface module (and md5 support module) for
		sending played tracks to last.fm. Requires setting the
		LASTFM_* keys in settings.hrl.
    </dd>

    <h3>The Main User-Interface</h3>

    <p>
      The user interface is constructed around static HTML pages which
      load static Javascript files from the server. The javascript
      files in turn access JSON-RPC services on the server using
      XmlHttpRequest.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>index.html</dt>
      <dd>
	Static HTML for the main Jukebox user interface. Loads <a
	href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype</a>, <a
	href="../priv/server_root/htdocs/json.js">json.js</a> and <a
	href="../priv/server_root/htdocs/jsonrpc.js">jsonrpc.js</a>
	support libraries before loading <a
	href="../priv/server_root/htdocs/client.js">client.js</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>client.js</dt>
      <dd>
	This file contains the main body of the user interface
	code. The static HTML hooks into the code in this file, both
	via event handlers on particular HTML elements and via the
	registration of <code>initClient()</code> as a window onLoad
	callback. When client.js is loaded, the first thing it does is
	build a proxy to the (non-configuration) server-side
	functionality of the application.
      </dd>

      <dt>json.js</dt>
      <dd>
	This is a slightly modified copy of an old JSON implementation
	from <a href="http://json.org/">json.org</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>jsonrpc.js</dt>
      <dd>
	This is a tiny, simple layer atop json.js and <a
	href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype</a> that accesses
	JSON-RPC services.
      </dd>

      <dt>jukeboxsession.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	This module defines a single JSON-RPC service. It implements
	the core API to the jukebox application.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>The Configuration Tool</h3>

    <p>
      The configuration tool is similar in construction to the main
      user interface, but is much simpler. It provides an interface to
      adding, removing and rescanning root URLs (with the
      functionality implemented by trackdb.erl, v.s.) and to saving a
      snapshot of the current in-memory database to the disk.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>config.html</dt>
      <dd>
	Static HTML for the configuration interface. Similar to
	index.html, except loads configclient.js instead of client.js.
      </dd>

      <dt>configclient.js</dt>
      <dd>
	This file contains the main body of the configuration tool
	code. Similar in structure to client.js, but based around a
	difference JSON-RPC service.
      </dd>

      <dt>configsession.erl</dt>
      <dd>
	JSON-RPC service definition and implementation for the
	configuration service.
      </dd>
    </dl>
